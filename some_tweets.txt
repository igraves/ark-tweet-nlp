$IBM Any day now we&#39;re gonna get a short covering rally when the elevator stops at the ground floor. And then we get hammer on the chart.
@CalculatorMan its down from the other day when some big hedge guy said bad things not earnings-bad earnings are ok in this mrk $ibm
$IBM who would have ever thought at these levels that ibm would be a short candidate? Now at 215, sure. But when it&#39;s around yearly support?
$IBM looks like the selling is drying up. I think the short attack is almost over. If they couldn&#39;t torpedo ibm after last Er, this won&#39;t.
$IBM looks like chart is tanking to new 52 weeks low..

$NUE bounce on our support alert today. Also long with stop just under 51
$NUE looking good. retracing back to the breakout point.. should bounce here.. . melt should begin today
$NUE further weakness this morning, approaching key support http://stks.co/avFS
Sold all $NUE today for avg +5%
$NUE bounced off the 50 day MA in late Aug and mid Oct after a pullback. ? now is will it find support @ $51. If not, it could be trouble.
$NUE 3 year chart is positive.  Analyst downgrades today are short term outlooks. http://stks.co/duHx
@The_Icahn_Top $NUE If they do $3 next year, a multiple of 20X would not be unreasonable for $60/share - 3 yr price trend is positive
@jdegiorgio $nue so if they are &quot;hoping&quot; to earn $3 next year, they deserve over $50 now ? with arguments on 2014 steel ? gl with that
@The_Icahn_Top - Motley Fool: Curb your enthusiasm fails to consider $NUE&#39;s 2014 EPS est. of +$3.00/share vs. $1.42/share in 2013
$nue. 50-51 excellent short term support .. Buying for a bounce if it hits today
@JBoorman $NUE takes these downgrades like the slag they are &amp; simply sweeps them aside.
$NUE has seen steep pullbacks like this before, trailing stop is just below the 50-day http://stks.co/qeuJ

today&#39;s dip in $KORS a buy opportunity.
$KORS Barron&#39;s influence is knocking the price down today. TIF reports tomorrow, and the high end luxury story will add another chapter...
$KORS Barron&#39;s is clueless, and did not do their homework. Promoting Kohl&#39;s over KORS is just silly...
Don&#39;t agree with Barronâ€™s Analysis. Believe that $KORS has a convincing growth plan &amp; that stock price will rise more http://stks.co/euuZ

$ORLY down 1.12 since 11/01; current down trend still in the works but possible reversal a good bet.
also $orly finding ultimate support at 100DayMA @128.06
My top trade idea -in $orly DEC 125s @ 2.40 watch for a powerful move to 128 - forming wedge  http://stks.co/jtMp
$ORLY the longer this stays here the greater the risk of a false break, stop is close below $123 http://stks.co/gt7t

$JCP we will . . . they just shaking out impatient longs and taking shares for the run higher
$JCP Hope we get a good bounce before Hoilday :X
$JCP hmmmm wonder who that is lol
$JCP news is getting 10s by tomorrow just like we said  . . . but ya didn&#39;t believe
$JCP why are we going up AH? any news?
$JCP - http://stks.co/qfuD
$JCP NICE read. Material for longs. Barrage for shrts. http://stks.co/hyUA
$JCP http://stks.co/avNa\n\nGood article
$JCP patience grasshoppers . . . busts through yet this afternoon.  That&#39;s what we said
If $JCP can do 1% YOY in Q4 it will mean $3.9B, a sequential increase of 41% - far better than anything the past 5 years
If $JCP revenue increase 36% sequentially from Q3 to Q4 (as it did in 2009) then rev will be $3.78B. Resulting in a decrease YOY of 3%
$JCP did 32% of their total annual revenue in Q4 of 2012, 2010, &amp; 2009
$JCP provided UPDATES on the Oct 7 and Nov 7. Sometime between DEC 6 - 10 will be a huge day for Longs and Shorts
$JCP Yes, another push into the toilet.
$JCP and here&#39;s the bounce . . .
$JCP we and others seeing to it . . . stay long
$JCP another push coming into close . . .
$JCP at least we are holding .40s till the end!
$jcp - love it that Imperial Capital ($1 price folks) increased their pt to $5, now that the short attack is over.  I hate manipulators
$JCP  It&#39;s so entertaining reading &quot;SISTER&quot; say what it hopes will be true.  Get a short skirt &amp; pompoms, you cheerleader.  Where&#39;s my 13s?
$JCP went shopping at JCP yesterday. good sales, great customer service.
&quot;@GrandMaster: $JCP short covering has started&quot; where??

Per Petsmart &quot;more than half of pet parents plan to give their pet a Holiday stocking&#39;. No scrimping hereâ€¦ $PETM
$petm on watch this morning- slightly slippy
Listen to $PETM Q3 2013 earnings call - live at 09:00 AM, ondemand after - http://stks.co/fxLF
$PETM 4Q forecast of $1.19-$1.23 a bit light of street estimates of $1.24. Not going to be enough to get the stock going IMO.
Basically an in-line quarter from $PETM. +2.7% comp store sales, $1.7 bil in revenue (vs. $1.7 bil estimate), 88 cents (vs. 86 cents).
&quot;@retail_guru: $PETM selling margin up in Q3; some relief after downside in Q2; and Q shows pet-parents are a cosy little niche to sell to&quot;
Still, Petsmart outlook not completely free of warts: Q4 comps guided to 2.5-3.5% vs prior 3-4% &amp; top end of guide penny shy of street $PETM
Petsmart selling margin up in Q3; some relief after downside in Q2; and Q shows pet-parents are a cosy little niche to sell to $PETM
Adjusted for lower tax rate, Petsmart Q in line with street (vs reported 2Â¢ beat). However, given lower comps, decent outcome $PETM
Respectable Q at Petsmart. Sales accelerated into finish as $PETM comps 2.7% vs lowered guide of 2.2-2.5%; margin +40bp, top end of guide

Bullish on $PM? Barclays thinks it&#39;s worth $95:http://stks.co/aug7
FWIW, Cramer just called $PM a &quot;sell sell sell&quot;.
LONG setup on $PM at open with 67 % chance http://stks.co/qeqM
$PM wow, looks like a lot of people thought it was oversold I got some at 85.49.
$PM this is a thing of beauty for long term holders, im giddy.
@TradeVestor BUY $PM this week - this puppy is heading to &lt;$82
@TheArmoTrader $PM If you bought is steadily over the past two years, that is irrelevant and just another buying opportunity
If u bought $PM the last time it was at ~85,u wld hv to wait 34 days for it to get to ~92.\nWell,it only took 2days for it to go from 92-&gt;85.
$PM  Not going much lower... can you say rare buying opportunity?
$PM technicals show that it still has ways to drop, I hope so, I need more div $$$ every 3 months to retire.
$PM Already long, but I&#39;ll add if dividend hits 5% (about $75).
Not calling a bottom, but people aren&#39;t going to quit smoking, $PM ain&#39;t going broke and the dividend gets juicier with every tick down.
$PM Ill buy some in the 60&#39;s, anyone want to sell to me at that price?
$PM these are the days you buy, no question. been waiting 2 months for this.
$PM is not dead money. Have you been overseas? People and kids smoke like chimneys. Not sexy, but a 4+ dividend is good ballast.

$REGN traders don&#39;t want to ruin their Thanksgiving hence the low volume today.
$REGN holding strong from its rip up couple days ago.  holding strong on 5 min.  Looks like a little consolidating before next leg up, $320
$REGN Biotech seems to want to sell a bit. Taking short 295
$REGN clears and holds $298.90 I will go long
$REGN Current leg is pointing straight at $320.
$REGN Kissed trend line and retreated. Bah! Better luck tomorrow. http://stks.co/jxt8
$REGN spends all but the first half hour of day in yawn mode...don&#39;t worry, more positive news on the way to kick off next leg up
$REGN @screaminbuys recommended that you purchase Jan 275 puts on 11/14, believe this guy, if you don&#39;t value $$$.
$REGN  puts are a SCREAMIN&quot; BUY. Optina will wipe out EYLEA, Lucentis and REGN. Research for yourself and don&#39;t believe REGN pushers.
$REGN still no question this stock is a buy below 300 in my mind.  But if you are playing front month options or weeklys, good luck
$REGN Needs to get back above 293 and hold at least.
Relative strength in $REGN doesn&#39;t support the Fri breakout.  Wkly chart doesn&#39;t either at this point
