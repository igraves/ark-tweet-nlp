@pointbreaker - well we&#39;ll know soon if $EBAY reverses or not - either way the next move will probably be big
$EBAY I am looking to nibble very soon!.
$EBAY: way safer investment than AMZN..it is value status when compared to it.
Share an idea on $EBAY 52 wk low and candlestick shows selling abating. Stoch golden cross. Reversal to 53 eminent.
$EBAY we got more institutional buyers than sellers 9/7 ...  http://stks.co/hyrh
$52 a prob. $46 will get volume on backfill. Stock is trading below years open. All about Payments division growing revs imho . $EBAY
@pointbreaker $EBAY isn&#39;t going to much of a short squeeze with only 1.5% of the float short - still, looks like it wants to recover
$EBAY I suggest you not think this is going to reverse. It is broken. Will fake you out but going lower for some time yet. Dec 30th buy
&quot;@TraderRL23: $EBAY eBay, potential reversal pattern. Stop is well defined . . http://stks.co/sg7d&quot; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Confirmed with up move today
$EBAY should ebay accept Bitcoin? The Case Against  Bitcoin. http://stks.co/rgLN
$EBAY  - a little premature to fully load if one is waiting for solid confirmation of reversal but went for it.
$EBAY Picked up some January $50 calls for $2 today, looking at 5 year chart &amp; fundamentals - due for a big bounce
$EBAY moved to B list.  Starting to look interesting...
$EBAY Needs to break 50.
I posted $EBAY Short a few days ago, now we see an upthrust test, another place to short http://stks.co/fydb
$EBAY another attempt at shot sqz ....
$EBAY here we go, getting some energy.
$EBAY Starts The Black Friday Deals Early In 2013 http://stks.co/fycz

$EBAY I&#39;m not gonna sell it. it&#39;s not over. Christmas is yet to come lol

$F Nice move. Go for the 50 day. :)
$F is this dreem ?
$F Microsoft CEO talk will make this move. They met candidates 6 days ago. I should have camped out and looked for Mulally.
$F BB squeeze and bouncing off up line. Close above 17.05 for Bull engulf. Looking good,but heavy manipulated.
$F 88% gains in a little over a year ain&#39;t so bad.
$F I am still waiting to dump this piece of garbage. most pathetic stock I&#39;ve ever owned. boring

$NFLX So it depends..at 50x 2015=$545  50x 2014=$326.5 (PEG is less than 1), 100x 2014=$654 assuming PEG less than 1.
$NFLX  2012 - $1.04    2013 $2.90    2014  $6.53   2015 $10.40....Growth rate is tremndous...50-100 PE is justified based on PEG..
$NFLX For all the people on here who are saying &quot;overvalued&quot;...I think you need to do more research. Will post analyst estimates.
@rahagar I don&#39;t currently have a position in $NFLX.
$NFLX: will this amazing company be the first to reach a $1 trillion market cap? If you listen to Reed Hastings and  the analysts, it will.
$NFLX: when will Icahn sell his other half? Maybe he already did
The Street Remains Stubbornly Bearish Toward Netflix, Inc. ($NFLX) http://stks.co/rgRD

$NFLX www.cnn.com
$NFLX http://stks.co/fylp going down.....................................................................................................
$NFLX Possible strategy...there could be a potential shorting opportunity at $389 (test double top thesis) but would wait for confirmation.
$NFLX would ordinarily have triggered re-entry but initial stop at 314 too rich, others preferred  http://stks.co/evhQ
$NFLX Some will say that the fundas are not right..they have not been right for the past 212 points and may not be right for another $100.
$NFLX Icahn selling to take profits on half his position after a 400% runup in his holdings is not a reason to be short either.
$NFLX The reasons Netflix will continue to rally- (1) cable wars and acq rumours (2) eoy window dressing (3) ppv content could be introduced
$NFLX Its amazing how many shorts are on this board...wonder if all are short and losing money.
$NFLX:another big jump.This one is being fueled by pure greed &amp; short covering.Once the shorts are out of commission the party will be over

$NUE Nucor, broke out and now re testing big levels.... . http://stks.co/qgKf
$NUE Nucor, looking interesting on this pullback. Stalking. . http://stks.co/iyfL
$NUE why I sometimes say &#39;clean break&#39; of level reqd, especially as this has history of marginal 50-day breaks that reversed
$NUE this is good *rare* example of when discretion can be used on stop, as part of support zone http://stks.co/rgMR
@JBoorman $NUE Would you enter on this pullback? No position
$NUE getting very close to trailing stop level but appears to be slowing on approach http://stks.co/qg5V
$NUE bounce on our support alert today. Also long with stop just under 51
$NUE looking good. retracing back to the breakout point.. should bounce here.. . melt should begin today
$NUE further weakness this morning, approaching key support http://stks.co/avFS
Sold all $NUE today for avg +5%
$NUE bounced off the 50 day MA in late Aug and mid Oct after a pullback. ? now is will it find support @ $51. If not, it could be trouble.
$NUE 3 year chart is positive.  Analyst downgrades today are short term outlooks. http://stks.co/duHx
@The_Icahn_Top $NUE If they do $3 next year, a multiple of 20X would not be unreasonable for $60/share - 3 yr price trend is positive
@jdegiorgio $nue so if they are &quot;hoping&quot; to earn $3 next year, they deserve over $50 now ? with arguments on 2014 steel ? gl with that
@The_Icahn_Top - Motley Fool: Curb your enthusiasm fails to consider $NUE&#39;s 2014 EPS est. of +$3.00/share vs. $1.42/share in 2013
$nue. 50-51 excellent short term support .. Buying for a bounce if it hits today

@TrueChartTrader Had 500 shares at 62, sold half @ 80 -- letting the rest ride. $KORS has been good to me..forcing myself to lock in profits
$KORS they have been fading this 81.2 to 80. 80.8 to 80 pretty easily. but not sure who was selling to help the fade LOL.
$KORS as i have been telling, excellent stocks/charts like this  WILL NOT give entries. take out of 85 will be good in volume early nxt week
$KORS nice action. hold core and trade around.
$KORS testing trend baseline support &amp; small pennant. todays bounce is good indicator for longs. http://stks.co/fyeQ
$KORS a rip with 4 to 6mn and take out of 85 will be awesome. the fall from 83 to 79 was in super super low volume.
$KORS A holiday winner as their handbags and watches are &quot;must have&quot; holiday gift items. The stock is seeing low volume holiday trading...
$KORS a close above 82 is what the doctor ordered. and basing 82 to 83 for a week will be healthy for a 92 to 110 move.
$KORS nice little jump in stock price
$KORS i have been noting that they were chasing this at 82.5 and 83 and selling all week in low volume at 80. not sure why.
$KORS volume running little higher. we ned 4mn today (2.5 mn in last 2 hours) to take this and base above 82.
$KORS this is SUPER healthy action. if it can close above 82 and use 82 as support, then 87 to 92 can come quickly. basing is critical.
$KORS Wtf today.  The market maker take the day off.
$KORS has to get above the $81.25 line, has been above it since 915( central time)
$KORS Rock it out post lunch today !
$KORS this was 79 in sept 1st week. if you are buy/hold type has done NOTHING in last 3 months. usually momo stocks RARELY give entries!!
$kors ole faithful putting in a nice short base above 79.  They shud release the kracken again soon
Michael Kors Holdings ($KORS) Highlighted As Momo Momentum Stock http://stks.co/iyVF  via @TheStreet
$KORS 700K volume in 1 hour looks high as it was doing 2.5 mn all day. if this can retain volume to 3.5 to 5mn this can do 83 today.
$KORS is currently my best performer, its up 1%

$PETM In-depth review of their performance in the last 3 months at today Q3 call http://stks.co/buDz
Petsmart transactions near flat at +0.2%; slowest in quite a while. Still, spend/shopper steadily growing in line with prior trends $PETM
Per Petsmart &quot;more than half of pet parents plan to give their pet a Holiday stocking&#39;. No scrimping hereâ€¦ $PETM
$petm on watch this morning- slightly slippy
Listen to $PETM Q3 2013 earnings call - live at 09:00 AM, ondemand after - http://stks.co/fxLF
$PETM 4Q forecast of $1.19-$1.23 a bit light of street estimates of $1.24. Not going to be enough to get the stock going IMO.
Basically an in-line quarter from $PETM. +2.7% comp store sales, $1.7 bil in revenue (vs. $1.7 bil estimate), 88 cents (vs. 86 cents).
&quot;@retail_guru: $PETM selling margin up in Q3; some relief after downside in Q2; and Q shows pet-parents are a cosy little niche to sell to&quot;
Still, Petsmart outlook not completely free of warts: Q4 comps guided to 2.5-3.5% vs prior 3-4% &amp; top end of guide penny shy of street $PETM
Petsmart selling margin up in Q3; some relief after downside in Q2; and Q shows pet-parents are a cosy little niche to sell to $PETM
Adjusted for lower tax rate, Petsmart Q in line with street (vs reported 2Â¢ beat). However, given lower comps, decent outcome $PETM
Respectable Q at Petsmart. Sales accelerated into finish as $PETM comps 2.7% vs lowered guide of 2.2-2.5%; margin +40bp, top end of guide

@TradeVestor BUY $PM this week - this puppy is heading to &lt;$82
@TheArmoTrader $PM If you bought is steadily over the past two years, that is irrelevant and just another buying opportunity
If u bought $PM the last time it was at ~85,u wld hv to wait 34 days for it to get to ~92.\nWell,it only took 2days for it to go from 92-&gt;85.
$PM  Not going much lower... can you say rare buying opportunity?
$PM technicals show that it still has ways to drop, I hope so, I need more div $$$ every 3 months to retire.

$PXD back up the truck here. This time next year you&#39;ll be glad you did!
$PXD 900,000 acres in the Spraberry Field, 50-100 billion barrels oil in place, $12/bbl finding cost, $40/bbl margins at $80 = $$$$$$$$$
$PXD even with falling WTI$ company is heavily hedged into 2014 and margins are increasing. Buying opportunity from here!

@Portfoolio I agree.Long $BAC shares@5.25-5.50 I trade options on top using long option kickers at MAX inflection point NOT brain surgery
$BAC My guess is that the judge&#39;s approval of the $8.5B settlement is NOT baked into the stock price yet.
@bitioustrader Not all boats ride the same wave but the current is pushing them all and $BAC &#39;s wave is the Big Kahuna and will rise again.
$BAC how come bac close in the red and other financials close in the green, then AH bac went into the green and other financials went red?
$BAC The repurchase should be over by end of DEC or first 2 weeks of JAN worst case. Hopefully b4 earnings. Another reason to pop.
$BAC If you have money and like money; BUY-Don&#39;t be scared just like last year when you didn&#39;t buy @$5-Don&#39;t miss out again and buy already
$BAC This is $30 before 16 and possibly much more. Forward looking it will be.
$BAC When the stock trades at $20, big institutional investors will buy it expecting $30 in the next 3-5 years. This run hasn&#39;t even started
$BAC Sorry for being crazy bullish but I&#39;ve been following this closely for over a year and have never been more confident than I am now.
@mytfine I am going to retire on my profit from $BAC and so will everyone else who has been listening to me since $9.
@Portfoolio right banks aren&#39;t stealing my interest. Your fascination with $BAC is amusing. Don&#39;t take it so personally. Happy Thanksgiving.
Betsy Graseck, the best analyst on $BAC, puts $20 target and $25 &quot;bull case&quot;.
$BAC FYI futures on FIRE. Nikkei on FIRE. Friday could be crazy.
$BAC  order executed   Sharers purchased  at $15.80 ah
$BAC Short squeeze.com says shorts have 1.3 days to cover. Would thanksgiving count as a day or is it market days? Looks like 117 mil short
$BAC it&#39;s ok to be down, I doubt on Friday what trend, lots of put got traded today, make me nervous, would like to see 17 next week though

$CELG likely to test the 9ema,, then should resume higher.. look for a bounce 159s http://stks.co/fygt
$CELG cant go up everyday people treat this as a consolidation point. Im holding until January earnings -- Long!
$CELG what happens with a gap up, gap may get filled but low today did not hit gap low on friday. the gap at low 160 should be a swing stop.
$CELG i am out. looks like will go down you can catch it lower from here. good luck. happy holidays
$CELG good entry point for folks who want to get in. possibility to close lower for next few days
$CELG trading below the pivot point of 162. we need above 162 to close higher
$CELG mid day run... chart should go high 162 and if it holds will go higher towards the close other wise we should close in low 162.
$CELG RSI indicator showing short term bearish. possibly going down further for few days.
$CELG Why is this one dropping so much?
$CELG two scenario possible high 163.6 and then down, today. 2nd scenario low of 160.x and close 162.x
$CELG options volume is at 165 strike. let us see how this plays out. i think it is a daily setup today. might go160.9 today and reverse
$CELG possible reversal today...
$CELG looks like profit taking sell off.
$CELG Celg looks really good if it can get over 166!!
Piper Jaffray Resumes Celgene ($CELG) at Neutral http://stks.co/avNd
$CELG tomorrow is important for celg. if we close red i think we might see some drop and consolidation before moving higher
$CELG nice consolidation today at 163.xx final hour let us see if it goes higher..
Celgene $CELG stock sentiment bullish: http://stks.co/qfoO Image:  http://stks.co/hyOz
$CELG stock at pivot point right now. resistance at 164.96. it it cross 164.96 goes higher to 168 to 170
$CELG options is still good on volume side. i am hoping this might go over 165 today
$CELG i think if we close today below 165 then stock is going through consolidation might be short term bearish

$AMZN it is silly time for the high fliers as risk off now in full gear.  (no position)
If you don&#39;t take profits when a stock moves up 30% in six weeks while the CEO dumps shares you have only yourself to blame. $AMZN
$AMZN $400 seems to be the goal now. Just bought $380 dec calls
@Fibline @KidDynamiteBlog Which is why $AMZN will be profit less in perpetuity. Scouring the net for loss leaders is a losing game.

$BAC Whats the probability BAC will hit 16 before Jan 18?
$BAC Lord knows the bids are plenty
$BAC very disappointing today. Not bad but not great. I should have stayed asleep than get up
$BAC It seems the bids do get pulled. Still long
$BAC .11 from 16.00, .09 away from prev high
$BAC Bought more.
$BAC Wow, now no bid on nov 16c weekly.
$BAC 9+ million shers to hit 15.90 and in the blink of an eye .05 drop?
$BAC Makes you wonder
$BAC 16.+ is in the works
$BAC manipulation.
$BAC For those who keep asking this question, market closes today at 1pm. Write it down. The most faded ink is better than the best memory!
$BAC Good open, No gap
$BAC What time is market close?
$BAC Winner!!!\nhttp://stks.co/hz1y
$BAC I&#39;m thinking 16.31 today, top end of the daily
$BAC Moynihan once sat next to Buffett to a student 3 months back and said &quot;Just buy BAC, and you&#39;ll be alright&quot;... Guess he was right :)
$BAC Anyone else worried about these knuckleheads causing a market selloff in Jan &#39;14? http://stks.co/rgY4
$BAC looks like someone is picking up a bunch under 16
$BAC Volume is lite because of the holiday. Let&#39;s see what the day brings
$BAC seems as though buying is slowing down. Trend seems to have broke out. Will see through todqys action
$BAC Nov 16$ calls=worthless

New high w/lower macd last week for $ba could mean a 50ma test. Coupled w/top of gap support would make nice entry 125-126ish.

$MU reiterated by TheStreet Ratings as a buy
$MU If this thing bounces to $19 I will get back in....see the stock over $25 in Q1/14

$MU There is no bad price on MU at this point, only a cheaper price. Stock hasn&#39;t sold off much each dip below oversold levels.
$MU I think there&#39;s one more push left in today and then I&#39;m closing out the weeklies. Breakeven at $21.10
$MU there&#39;s a reason this was trading $21.40 premarket...volume is surprisingly decent today
$MU nice reversal/ recovery. On it&#39;s way back to unchanged.
$MU reload $19&#39;s
$MU going under $20 today
$MU Be careful longs as many have huge gains and likely to sell some. Good luck.
